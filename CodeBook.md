## Code book for the Tidy Data Set Created in the Course Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Course

This cook book document aims to describe what variables are in the tidy data set.

The tidy data set was derived from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set", which are data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description of the experimental design and the raw data set itself can be found here:

The original raw data set used for generating this tidy data set can be downloaded here:

Please refer to the README.md file on how the tidy data set was created.
