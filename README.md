## Course Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Course

### Background

A tidy data set was created as requested according to instructions given in the course project. For reader who are not fellow student and would like to know more about this course, please refer to:

https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata

This README.md file serves to give the reader (you) an overview of what the data set is about, and how it was created, etc.

The tidy data set was derived from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set", which are data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description of the experimental design and the raw data set itself can be found here:

The original raw data set used for generating this tidy data set can be downloaded here:

The process of derving the tidy data set from the original raw data set was automated using an R script `run_analysis.R`. The rest of this README.md will describe what files are included along with the tidy data set and the process of how it was created.

### The dataset includes the following files

- run_analysis.R : An R script that convert the orignal raw data set into a tidy data set and export it to a text file `tidyDataSetMeanValues.txt`


listing all the related files, 
instructions on how to use the script, 
a general description of the raw data and it's source, 
a description of what the script will do



how the script work
