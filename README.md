## Course Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Course

### Background

A tidy data set was created as requested according to instructions given in the course project. For reader who are not fellow student and would like to know more about this course, please refer to:

https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata

This README.md file serves to give the reader (you) an overview of what the data set is about, and how it was created, etc.

The tidy data set was derived from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set", which are data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description of the experimental design and the raw data set itself can be found here:

The original raw data set used for generating this tidy data set can be downloaded here:

The process of derving the tidy data set from the original raw data set was automated using an R script *run_analysis.R*. The rest of this README.md will describe what files are included along with the tidy data set and the process of how it was created.

### The data set includes the following files

- README.md: This file :)
- run_analysis.R : An R script that convert the orignal raw data set into a tidy data set and export it to a text file *tidyDataSetMeanValues.txt*
- tidyDataSetMeanValues.txt: *The* tidy data set. This was also uploaded to Coursera's submission page and was included in this repo for convenience. This data set has 180 obervations (rows) and 68 variables (columns, to be described in the code book).
- codeBook.md: The code book that describes the naming convention of the variables and the variables themselves.
